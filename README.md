// Humu Code Challenge Questions

1. Are there any questions would you ask to a designer who sent this mockup and spec?

- After viewing the mock pdf, a few questions that I would ask the designer are: a) What are the names of the other departments?
b) Is there a list of department leads and number of employees for each department?
c) What is the deadline for this project?

2. Did you make any assumptions while developing this page?

- My assumptions were minimal while developing this page. I wasn't sure if I should start with a basic HTML page or use my knowledge in React, so I applied both. As a refresher to brush up on my front end skills, I utilized a bootstrap to help me come up with ideas on how to design a more, presentable page in React JS. The bootstrap allowed me to use the color codes provided and make the page simple, yet stylish. 

- I must admit that I had an issue with developing the page in Reactjs because I have been recently developing projects with iOS code. In a previous project, I was able to import React, ReactDOM, create components and css/scss style sheets correctly, and test my code in Jest. I wasn't able to achieve it this time, however I will brush up on my front end skills.

3. You donâ€™t need to make this responsive but if given more time, how would you make it responsive? 

- Building a page from scratch and adding media queries for mobile optimization is one way I could make a page responsive. Using a bootstrap template that is customized to be displayed on any device is another option.   

4. If given more time, how would you improve readability and accessibility? 

- To improve readability, I would create a README file with details on the purpose of the application and instructions on how to use it. It's important for me to understand how the code works, and what it does. Functionality of an application is very important to me. 
- After improving readability, I go through a series of debugging and testing to make sure every user can easily access the application.
